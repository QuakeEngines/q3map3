WINDOWS USERS: 
Be sure to set your PATH to [install_path]/q3map3/binaries where 'install_path' is the 
git repository's root folder. Binaries contains all of the .dll files necessary for 
GTKRadiant.exe and q3map3.exe to run. 

*NIX USERS: 
Follow the installation directions using scons. 


****NOTE****
I've renamed the STLport folder to STLportl as a quick way to compile without
Visual Studio complaining about pre-existing functions.

Rename the STLportl file back to STLport if you want to use it.
